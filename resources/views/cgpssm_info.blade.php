  <tr><h2 style="color:#ec842f;"><b><i><u>Introduction  CGPSSM :-</u></i></b></h2> <br><p>&nbsp;Relates to Meditation specially Anapanasati Meditation, Pyramid Meditation, Vegetarianism followed by this Spiritual Institution, which is in Chhattisgarh State. 
The Head Office of this institution is in Raipur and is led by the President of CGPSSM Mr. Shailendra Jain. This institution is guided by PSSM (Pyramid Spiritual Societies Movement) under the leadership of Brahmarshi Patri ji of Bangalore. 
 </p>
<p>In other words, we can say that CGPSSM is a co-operative branch of PSSM whose work area includes the city of Raipur & Chhattisgarh State. The work of CGPSSM is to spread among the masses Anapanasati Meditation, Pyramid Meditaion and Vegetarianism.</p></tr><br>

<tr><h2 style="color:#ec842f;"><b><i><u>Foundation at Raipur :-</u></i></b></h2><br><p>The foundation of CGPSSM at Raipur, in 1998 was a matter of co-incidence. Brahmarshi Shri Subhash Patri ji was on his tour to Raipur, SriSrimal family, along with Mr. Shailendra Jain got acquainted with Patriji & then they had deep discussions regarding the spreading of Meditation. As a result of this, considering the impact & importance of meditation Mr. Shailendra Jain took the responsibility of spreading this technique to the whole of Chhattisgarh.</p>
  <p>In 1998, it first started in the presence of Patri ji who conducted Meditation classes at their Chaubey Colony residence. Mr. Shailendra Jain, received a great amount of support & help from his family, friends & other co-operative personalities. Raipur, at that time was a part of MP. Hence its impact on the political, Industrial, Educational Spiritual, Religious & cultural aspects were significant. Chhattisgarh state was not prevailing at that time, but geographically, a part for Chhattisgarh, was pre-decided </p>
</tr><br>
<tr><h2 style="color:#ec842f;"><b><i><u>Motive of establishment & primary work:-</u></i></b></h2><br><p>CGPSSM was established with the motive to spread Anapanasati Meditation. To this meditation as well as to make people do. Anapanasati Meditation is a very simple procedure, which even the rural population of Chhattisgarh can practice and benefit from. This institution contacted the other major cities of Chhattisgarh & got attached with people taking initiative. Firstly Bilaspur & then Bhilai, Durg then some people from Rajnandgaon were taken in account for this work. Today in Bilaspur & Bhilai Anapanasati Meditation is being taught & the people’s interest & zeal, enthusiasm can be noticed. With respect to meditation, this institution has worked in the spheres of Pyramid & Vegetarianism. Also, programs have been organized from time to time to make each & every episode well known. Patriji himself & the intellectual masters related to PSSM have kept on traveling here. For propaganda, the institution made arrangements for the distribution of literature. Chhattisgarh is a Hindi- Speaking state. The communicative language is Hindi & the State language is Chhattisgarhi. Literature regarding Meditation was mostly in Telugu, Tamil or English. To translate the materials in Hindi & to circulate its work, the processes were undertaken by CGPSSM. To work on this, the institution has made permanent arrangements for the varied outlook.</p>

  <tr><h2 style="color:#ec842f;"><b><i><u>Pyramid (it working & Installation ) :-</u><i></b></h2><br> <p>
In Maditation, the importance of Pyramid is always there. Along with meditation, we also make people aware about Pyramids. We incourage people to sit inside a pyramid & do meditation That is why a need to make a pyramid, for the institution was a necessity feeling the dire necessity, Kanger Vally Academy, in its own premises, got a Pyramid made for it self, which was unveiled inaugurated by Patriji, on 22nd Feb 2007, in this pyramid there is a king’s Chamber which can accommodate I it, in sitting mae, 5 to 6 people. Including the King’s chamber, within the pyramid, more than 50 people can sit at a time & meditate For the meditators, the pyramid is open from morning till night. Around the pyramid, there is nature’
S beauty. Green trees & flower’s parts of surrounding nature. Nearby there is a pond in which on the lotus, the white statue of lord Mahaveer Stands Maditators are attracted by this stature & also encouraged by it . the environment here is calm & the fragrance of the flowers scatter this place with its rich sence. On every poornima, night group meditation is done here. Time to Time, many workshops on meditation are also conducted here. Learned Masters with respect to the filds are called upon and they on their guidelines conduct workshops here.</p>

<tr><h2 style="color:#ec842f;"><b><i><u>Primary job of attaching school children with Meditation :- </u><i></b></h2><br> <p>With the installation of Pyramid, “Mahaveer Dhyana Kendra” has also been established in this Meditation Centre. The students from Kaanger Valley Academy were taken inside the Pyramid to meditate, this was the initial step. This was a kind of curiosity & entertainment for the students. But this experiment, through meditation helped them to calm their minds & proved effective. To create an impact of Meditation in this Academy to teach meditation, on special grounds, teachers were recruited, who can teach meditation & it’s advantages. This is on –going process.</p></tr><br>

<tr><h2 style="color:#ec842f;"><b><i><u>To relate Meditation with education :-</u></i> </b></h2> <br><p>A unique initiative & a major step.
Meditation is the only means by which one can get attentive, calm & focused. Meditation impacts the brain & its nerves, they become energetic, memory is enhanced. Our body is active & full of energy. Energy is maintained. The advantages of meditation, can be observed among students & looking forward to its core value & with the efforts of PSSM, in the school & college level, to impart meditation & spiritual science, Pyramid Spiritual Science Academy was founded and through Karnataka Pyramid Dhyana Prachar Trust, books were published. At present these text books form a part of curriculum from the 6th to the 12th standard in Raipur, under the guidance of CGPSSM & in the whole of India, as a model, Kaanger Valley Academy & RIT College have started teaching this since 2011. It is a matter of great pride for CGPSSM to inculcate this process. The institute is looking forward for its curriculum to be launched in other schools & colleges too. Through this recognition, the schools & colleges of the entire State will be affiliated & spiritual science will come under way.

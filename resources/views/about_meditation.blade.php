  <tr><p>Meditation is a process of making our minds empty and free from all
thoughts. Anapanasati is a simple way of doing Meditation.</p></tr>

<tr><p>The term Anapanasati in Pali language means the following:</p>
<p>Ana means breathing in.</p>
<p>Apana means breathing out.</p>
<p>Sati means being together</p>
<p>
Thus it means being with the breath or observing the breath.
Through Anapanasati Meditation we can enjoy total health, spiritual
wisdom and joy.</p>
<p> 
In Anapanasati, we observe our own breath. We do not chant any
mantra. We do not imagine any god or goddesses in the mind. We do not
do any breathing exercises also.

<h3><kbd>Diseases are healed</kbd></h3>

<pre>Spiritual health is the root and physical
 health is the fruit.Meditation is the greatest 
 gift we can offer ourselves to enrich our own
lives.
All physical afflictions are because of mental
 worries. All mental worries are because of 
 intellectual immaturity. Intellectual immaturity
is because of lack of spiritual energy and
lack of spiritual wisdom.
Through meditation, when we get
abundant spiritual energy and spiritual
wisdom, we will have better understanding
ability and the intellectual power.
Gradually all mental worries will
disappear. Consequently, all physical
pains will vanish. Meditation is the only way
 to heal all diseases.</pre>
</div>
 <div class="col-sm-6">
<h3><kbd>Memory-power is enhanced</kbd></h3>

<pre>
The abundant spiritual energy gained in
meditation helps the brain to work more
efficiently and to its fullest capacity. 
Meditation enhances memory power tremendously.

Therefore, meditation is absolutely necessary
for students at all levels.</pre>
</div>
 <div class="col-sm-6">
<h3><kbd>Mind becomes more joyful</kbd></h3>
<pre>
We at times come across failures, insults
and pains in our life. However, for a
person with spiritual wisdom and spiritual
energy, life is always peaceful and joyful in
spite of all the failures, insults and pains.</pre>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-6">
<h3><kbd>Greater efficiency in work</kbd></h3>
<pre>
In the presence of abundant spiritual
energy and spiritual wisdom, all work, be it
physical or mental, gets done with greater
efficiency. In less time, we are able to do
more work. With least resources, we can do
commendable work.</pre>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-6">

<h3><kbd>Sleep-time gets reduced</kbd></h3>
<pre>
Abundant spiritual energy is
obtained in meditation. Only a
fraction of that energy is obtained
during sleep.

Half an hour of deep meditation is
equivalent to six hours of deep sleep.
So when we meditate for half an
hour, we give six times more rest to the
 body and six times more energy 
to the mind.</pre>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-6">


<h3><kbd>Will-power increases</kbd></h3>

<pre>Thoughts need sufficient energy
and sufficient power to produce
their respective results. In a
restless state of mind, thoughts
are produced with least power.
Therefore, they don't produce
proper results.
However, in the presence of a
restful state of mind, all positive
thoughts acquire greater power and 
all thoughts meet with success. In
short, the will-power gets increased 
tremendously.</pre>

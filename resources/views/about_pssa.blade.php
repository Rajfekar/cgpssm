  </u></i></b></h2><br>
  <p>
  Pyramid Spiritual Science Academy of Raipur is a wing of Pyramid Spiritual Societies Movement (PSSM) of India founded by Brahmarshi Subash Patri ji in the year 1990 with the objective of spreading the basics of Spiritual Realities and Spiritual Science to every individual. PSSA has come into existence with the joint efforts of Chairman Patri ji & voluminous vision of Vice Chairman Shri Shailendra Jain ji in expert view of Dr Shivramappa (V.C. & M.D.) in the year 2010. </p>

    <p>Our motive is to germinate spiritual awareness among the students of schools and colleges, which could help them to understand the human values. And with love, forgiveness, faith, honesty and friendliness they could make their lives progressive. This would result a positive attitude towards life and the vital values would help them to lead a miraculous, controlled and prosperous life.  In the same regard we have introduced the systematically codified text books as per the CBSE curriculum.
  </p>
  
<p>As of now, 250 + schools across the nation have adopted our concept,  leading a way towards team work, leadership, discipline, listening skills, patience enhancement, and destined goal manifestation among their students.</p>

<p>PSSA unit at Raipur is taking care of the Spiritual Text Books publishing and distribution all over the nation and now even beyond. At present we print the books in four languages i.e. English, Hindi, Telugu & Kannada. Further onto other languages. Promotion of Spiritual Science education, seminar conduction, meditation sessions, classes, training of Meditation Masters, distribution of books, monitoring of the classes and regular feedback are some of the basic steps of PSSA’s movement.  </p>

<p>PSSA does this to spread Harmony among the society through students who are the Nation Builder. Caste and religion are no barricades for being a part of this association. No profit or individual benefit is taken by PSSA on any ground. It aims to spread awareness towards the self and its power through education.

<tr><h2 style="color:#639330;text-align:center;"><b><i><u>Why does PSSM & PSSA promote Pyramids?</u></i></b></h2><br><p>Pyramids are considered to be the energy amplifiers. They are resonant to the earth’s magnetic field and create life force energy. “Pyra”comes from the Greek word fire and mid from the Latin word “Mede” which means middle. So Pyramid is actually “Fire in the middle”. Fire in the middle is an apt description for the natural life energy force that is found in the center of the Pyramid.
The shape of Pyramid is like the Carbon Atom which is one of the base structures of creation. The Carbon Atom is a tetrahedron and has the inherent characteristic that when aligned to magnetic north, it rings and sings. The pyramid shape acts like a lens and focuses the earth’s magnetism. All pyramids, whether they are in Egypt or elsewhere on the planet earth, aligned to the magnetic north, which amplifies their energy.

 This energy is life force source energy, which surrounds all life form when active. Pyramid attracts positive etheric energy and converts the negative into positive ions.

 Study says, “The Great Pyramid’s elevation encodes three of the most important constants in mathematics: π (Pi), Φ (Phi), and e (Euler’s number). The slope angle of 51°51’ (51.85° in decimal form) comes from measurements taken off the remaining casing stones, according to detailed survey data from Flinders Petrie and J.H. Cole.
